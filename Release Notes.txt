12.25.2020: I wrote this program to randomize the appearance of some poker ships using IClone 3D software.

Here is the video if you care to watch:

(Fill In Link To Video After Its Made)

To run this program, create a "slice" image that is smaller than your "target" image. Createa  new image as your target, and 
set any background images or colors you want.

Then browse for the Slice Image and the Target Image.

Set your min and max values for Indent.

Click the Randomize Button and it should fill in the Target Image with the Source Image.

Save the image when ready. The image will be saved in the same directory the Slice Image comes from (or Target, not sure. Use the same directory and for sure I am right).,

Next to go https://github.com/DataJuggler/ImageRandomizer and star this project.

Next: (Optional) go to https://github.com/DataJuggler/ and find every project I have and star it.

Thank you
